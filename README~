      input:
	ingredients
		time of meal
		     location (maybe part of their profile)

Notes:
Each person has profile
Can rate the people they’ve cooked with?
    Need confirmation from both parties that the cooking happened
Can rate the recipes?
Maybe you can take a picture of the finished product and associate it with the recipe and with your profiles
Maybe can match up multiple people (up to groups of 4 or so?)
